# Resonant Break — Round 12 Brief

**ONE VERB:** TUNE

**GAME IN 10 WORDS:** You tune a resonance weapon to shatter crystalline enemies mid-pulse

**WHAT THE PLAYER MASTERS:** Reading an enemy's oscillating waveform — displayed as amplitude colour-shift and visual frequency — then holding your charge to match that exact frequency and releasing 0.2 seconds before the peak to account for strike delay; the skill is prediction, not reaction

**THE WOW MOMENT:** On wave 6, a conductor-class enemy broadcasts its frequency across every enemy simultaneously — one perfect tuned strike sends a harmonic that chain-shatters the entire formation in a single cascading implosion; the game has never once hinted this was possible

**WHY RICARDO:** Thumper (frequency must be matched by feel and eye — a mistimed release punishes with a dissonant screech that stuns you and the beat does not wait) + Gran Turismo (the gap between 94% and 100% frequency match is enormous: perfect resonance rewards slow-motion shatter and 3× score multiplier, imperfect resonance barely cracks the surface)

**EMOTIONAL ARC:**
- Start: First enemy pulses slowly, the waveform almost languid — you match it on the third attempt, hear a clean sustained ping, feel immediate physical satisfaction; the rule is self-evident
- Groove: Multiple enemies oscillating at different frequencies create visual noise you learn to read as a language — tuning feels like absolute fluency, every release deliberate and certain
- Climax: Final wave enemies drift their frequency continuously, never holding a target — you are chasing a moving note under a closing timer, making micro-corrections until the last possible moment of commitment; release too early or too late and the enemy explodes outward and damages you

**WHAT MAKES IT HARD:** Enemies never hold a static frequency — they drift within a range, so you must lead the target, releasing before the peak arrives rather than on it; this turns a reaction problem into a prediction problem, and the prediction window shrinks by 15ms each wave

**SKILL CEILING:** 1x player waits for the obvious peak, releases late, achieves ~70% match, partial shatter, resets. 10x player pre-aims 0.2 seconds early, lands 100% match, chains perfect shatters without a pause between enemies — the screen never goes dark between kills, the multiplier never resets

**VISUAL:** `#1A0A2E` `#E040FB` `#F5F5DC` — straight-on side view, enemies arrayed in receding depth layers; Dead Space surgical UI meets analogue oscilloscope glow

**AUDIO:** 140 BPM, sparse high-frequency melodic pulses that sync exactly to enemy oscillation cycles; signature SFX: a perfect resonance match produces a pure sine-wave ping sustaining for exactly one second — an imperfect match produces the same note clipped and distorted, like a wine glass struck wrong, cutting off in under 0.2 seconds

**NOT:**
- Not a rhythm game where you tap icons on a scrolling track
- Not a hold-to-charge power mechanic where more charge means more damage — power is irrelevant, only frequency match percentage matters
